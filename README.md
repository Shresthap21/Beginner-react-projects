Welcome to my collection of beginner-friendly React projects! 
This repository is aimed at helping newcomers grasp the basics of React through a series of small, manageable projects. I will be adding more projects over time, each focusing on different core concepts and techniques in React development.
Each project in this repository is designed to introduce a specific React concept, such as managing state, handling user inputs, or updating the UI dynamically. These projects are simple, interactive applications that gradually build foundational skills for anyone learning React.

Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Shresthap21/Beginner-react-projects.git

Install dependencies:
Each project has its own folder and dependencies.
Navigate to the specific project folder you want to work on:
   cd project-folder
